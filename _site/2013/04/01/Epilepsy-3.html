<div id="post">
  <p>I just read the my last post, and I'm thinking that everything feels so far in the past. I know that's a good feeling since life feels almost normal again.</p>

<p>I think there will always be parts of life that will remind me I'm "different." Most of the reminders have disappeared or are just worries that I can brush off. I'll always be
bothered that I can't live a totally care-free lifestyle like I used to, but I'll try to come as close as I can. I get small fears sometimes that I'll have another seizure,
but I always work to control those as well. Also, sometimes I feel pretty lonely that very few people I know feels some of these emotions, and I wouldn't want them to either.</p>

<p>In light of those negatives, I'm proud that I've come far enough to be thinking of them instead of the physical health problems. I don't intend to talk much more in this post about seizures or epilepsy, but instead about the removing the anxiety that leads to seizures.</p>

<p>Just like everyone else, life makes me anxious sometimes. But in my case, I make myself anxious more than life. If I'm dishonest, my brain ends up working against itself, and therein lies anxiety.</p>

<p>Here's an example.</p>

<p>I'm really good at lying to myself about things that make me uncomfortable. If I get embarrassed by something, I want to convince myself I'm not embarrassed to avoid being uncomfortable. So I build a conflict in my head - embarrassment versus my efforts to counteract them. It feels like I'm trying to reverse a waterfall. When I just admit that I'm embarrassed, the mess cleans itself up. I'm still embarrassed, the anxiety is gone, I'm comfortable, and I just go on with my life.</p>

<p>After I wrote that example, it felt pretty obvious that I'm a lot less anxious when I'm not working against myself.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other examples about how lying to myself leads to problems, but they're all pretty much the same. Lying to others creates a similar type of anxiety too. I make more work for myself to remember the lie, and sometimes come up with further lies to support the first one. It's all a waste of time and energy.</p>

<p>I'm glad it's only taken me 26 years to realize instead of a lot longer. This is the only time I can remember that I've felt this unconditional confidence and calm because I'm comfortable being honest with everyone, especially myself.</p>

<p>I'm proud to say (and thankful to everyone who helped) that I'm a much better person now than I was before my first seizure. Unfortunately it took 6 seizures and Epilepsy to spark this transition, but I'm here now and I'm happy for it. I haven't decided what I'll write about going forward, but I know that I'm gonna keep writing about my feelings, experiences, etc... These past 3 posts have made me understand myself more than anything else has, and I'll keep going as long as it helps.</p>
