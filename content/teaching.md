# Teaching & Community

I've spent the past 5 years teaching (primarily Go) and building open source communities. I currently run two programs to promote teaching Go to members of the community of all skill levels:

- [Go in 5 Minutes](https://goin5minutes.com) - a screencast series with the most concise, practical Go screencasts on the web
- [Go Study Groups](https://gophersource.com/study-group) - a casual meeting, similar to an unconference, for Gophers to chat about Go and meet other Gophers in the community

I've also run internal workshops and spoken at internal corporate events on the Go and Scala programming languages, and DevOps best practices.
