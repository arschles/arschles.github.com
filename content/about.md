# About Me

Howdy! I'm Aaron Schlesinger. I'm a
[Cloud Developer Advocate](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/index.html) at Microsoft, 
and I focus on [Go](https://golang.org), containers and 
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).

I've been a software engineer working on containers and Kubernetes, and 
previous to that, I built datastores and secure code execution environments
in Scala and Java.

You might know me from my screencast, 
[Go in 5 Minutes](https://goin5minutes.com), where I publish quick, focused
screencasts (about 5 minutes each - surprise!) about a single topic in the
Go ecosystem.

I also am a core maintainer of 
[The Athens Project](https://github.com/gomods/athens), which is a proxy 
for the Go modules system, and an emeritus chair of the 
[Kubernetes service catalog special interest group](https://svc-cat.io/).
