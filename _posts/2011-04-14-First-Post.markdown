I used to have a blog [on posterous](http://arschles.posterous.com). I'm moving to the new hotness that is Github Pages. I think it's pretty sweet that I can check in some code to a Github repository, and have it show up here. Pretty damn sweet. 

Thanks to [jqr](http://jqr.github.com) for lots of the code for this blog.
