summary: Github Pages FTW!

I used to have a blog [on posterous](http://arschles.posterous.com). I'm moving to the new hotness that is Github Pages. I think it's pretty sweet that I can check in some code to a Github repository, and have it show up here. Pretty sweet.

This blog is for code and technology, and I'm gonna write stuff down here as I discover useful stuff. Time for me to step it up!
