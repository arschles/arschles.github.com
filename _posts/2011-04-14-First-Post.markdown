I used to have a blog [on posterous](http://arschles.posterous.com). I'm moving to the new hotness that is Github Pages. I think it's pretty sweet that I can check in some code to a Github repository, and have it show up here. Pretty damn sweet. 

I stole a ton of code from the [jqr](http://jqr.github.com)'s [blog code](http://github.com/jqr/jqr.github.com), so thanks to him.
