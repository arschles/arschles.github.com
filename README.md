# Writing a new post:

1. add a file to the _posts directory called
  `$year-$month-$day-$title.markdown`
2. copy the header from an existing post
3. on the command line, run `bundle exec jekyll -w serve`
4. go to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to see the new post
5. make changes and repeat #4 as much as necesary
6. commit and push and your new post is live on the posts list at
  [arschles.github.io](http://arschles.github.io), or at
  `arschles.github.io/$year/$month/$day/$title.html`
